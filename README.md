Procedurally generated dungeon crawler. Web based, with a set seed per day (?). Everything is proceduarally generated, including potion effects, loot and monster behaviour. The idea being that to begin with it's unfair, but for each seed the game will be exactly the same, meaning you can just try again and learn from your mistakes.
